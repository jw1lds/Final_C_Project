# Final_C_Project
The piano program displays a piano graphic which highlights the current note being played and plays a sound of the corresponding frequency based on user keyboard input. The program also changes octaves when the user presses a number. This is all done with a switch statement that changes the value of the current frequency, the keyboard graphic, or octave based on letter or number keys pressed. The program also contains two if statements, one to close the program when the user presses ESC and one to silence the piano when the user presses SPACE. All these are contained inside in infinite while loop. The user input is obtained via getch() within a if statement stating that getch() should only be performed when the user presses a key via the kbhit() function. Youtube video:
